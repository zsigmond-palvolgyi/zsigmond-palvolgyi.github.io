I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Michigan. I am an applied microeconomist whose research covers topics in labor and public economics. 

Much of my research focuses on the impact of housing policies on residential segregation, racial wealth inequality, and human capital accumulation.

I am on the 2024-25 economics job market.
