I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Michigan. I am an applied microeconomist whose research covers topics in labor and public economics. 

Much of my research focuses on the impact of housing policies on residential segregation and racial wealth inequality. I am also interested in parental leave policies and the effect of parental wealth on human capital accumulation.

I am on the 2024-25 economics job market.
