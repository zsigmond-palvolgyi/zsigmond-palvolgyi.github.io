I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Michigan. I am an applied microeconomist whose research covers topics in labor and public economics. 

I study the impact of housing policies on residential segregation and racial wealth inequality. My other works focus on topics at the intersection of family economics, human capital accumulation, and inequality.

I am on the 2024-25 economics job market.
