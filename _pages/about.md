I am an Assistant Professor in the Institute of Economics at Corvinus University of Budapest.

I study how governmental policies shape inequality and how inequality influences economic decision-making. My main research agenda explores the impact of housing policies on residential segregation and racial wealth inequality. I also work on topics at the intersection of inequality, family economics, and human capital accumulation.

I received my PhD from the University of Michigan in 2025.
