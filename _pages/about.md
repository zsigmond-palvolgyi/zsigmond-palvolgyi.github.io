I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Michigan. I am an applied microeconomist whose research covers topics in labor and public economics. 

I study the impact of housing policies on residential segregation, racial wealth inequality, and human capital accumulation. My other works focuses on topics in family economics and intergenerational mobility.

I am on the 2024-25 economics job market.
